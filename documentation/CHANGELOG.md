  - Updated API data mapping in `src/app/api/linkedin/rescrape/route.ts` to align RapidAPI fields with internal artifact metadata structure (e.g., `summary` to `about`).
  - Added `formatDate` and `formatDuration` helpers.

### Fixed
- **Linting & Code Quality:**
  - Resolved numerous linter errors across various files, including:
    - `src/components/features/linkedin/LinkedInProfileModal.tsx`
    - `src/lib/hooks/useLinkedInModal.ts`
    - `src/types/artifact.ts` (with `eslint-disable` for `metadata: any`)
    - `src/types/rapidapi.ts`
    - `src/app/api/linkedin/rescrape/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/linkedin/import/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/artifacts/[id]/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/suggestions/apply/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/voice-memo/[id]/delete/route.ts`
    - `src/app/api/voice-memo/[id]/reprocess/route.ts`
    - `src/app/dashboard/contacts/page.tsx` (removed unused MUI imports)
    - `src/app/dashboard/contacts/[id]/page.tsx` (removed unused imports, typed `any` instances, fixed type mismatches for modal props, removed commented code).
  - Standardized error handling in API routes (typed catch errors as `unknown` with `instanceof Error` checks).
- **Data Display:** Addressed issues where some LinkedIn profile metadata fields (summary, experience, education) were not displaying in the modal by ensuring correct data fetching and propagation through RLS/select queries.
- **Re-scrape Logic:** Improved re-scrape trigger logic, including fetching `linkedin_url` from the `contacts` table as a fallback.
- **Visual Bugs:** Fixed header cutoff in `LinkedInProfileModal` by applying `flexShrink: 0`.

  - Specialized prompts for user self-reflection vs. contact relationship intelligence

### Technical Improvements
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Added Profile navigation to dashboard sidebar
- **Database Types**: Regenerated TypeScript types for new schema additions
- **Error Handling**: Improved profile creation fallback logic and error states
